Description:


In this project, we will create decision functions that attempt to 
predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each
passenger's features, such as sex and age. We will start with a 
simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to 
accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the 
provided data. 

The associated data for the analysis is attached in the repo as a 
csv file. The python file `visuals.py` is a utility file that is 
needed for the visuals to be outputted inside the jupyter notebook 
file.
