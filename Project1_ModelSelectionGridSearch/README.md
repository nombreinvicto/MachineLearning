Description:

In this project, a rigorous analysis has been done to demonstrate 
the steps ought to be followed in choosing the best machine 
learning algorithm for a multi-class classification task. A 
normally distributed, 2 feature, 3 class dataset was used in the 
analysis process.

Two machine learning models based on the Decision Tree Classifier 
and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier were employed in 
the classification task and their performances were compared. 
Final decisions on the applicability of the models were made based 
on the features of the models as delineated by investigations of 
their learning curves, decision boundaries and score metrics 
performances. GridSearch techniques were implemented to optimise 
pristine models and to bring improvements in their score metrics, 
and learning curve performances.
