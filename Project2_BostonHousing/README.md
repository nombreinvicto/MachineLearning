Description:

This repository contains source code, implementing a [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) 
Regressor Algorithm to predict housing prices of Boston from a 1978
dataset. A rigorous treatment of data exploration followed by model
 generation and selection (via learning curves, cross validation 
 etc), optimization (via GridSearch, hyperparameter tuning etc) 
 and robustness checking was done to assess the validity of the trained model. A 
 testing r2 score of around 77% was obtained with the finally 
 optimised model and the performance of the model was checked 
 against sample test data with subsequent sanity checks on the 
 predictions.
