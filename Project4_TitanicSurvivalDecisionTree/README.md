Description:

This repository contains source code, implementing a Decision Tree 
Classifier model to predict survival rates for the Titanic Dataset 
encountered in [Project 0](https://github.com/nombreinvicto/MachineLearning/tree/master/Project0_TitanicSurvival).
A decision tree classifier with optimised hyperparameters 
(obtained via GridSearch) was able to obtain an impressive accuracy
 of around 88% on testing data. This was atleast an 8% increase over 
 the crude model constructed in Project 0.

Technology Used:

* Python 3

Libraries Used:
