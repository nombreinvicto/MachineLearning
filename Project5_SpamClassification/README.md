Description:

This repository contains source code, implementing the design of a 
spam sms classifier using the Naive Bayes Algorithm in 
the scikit-learn package. The primary goal was to isolate spam text 
messages from a text collection [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).
The dataset was skewed with majority of the text messages not being
 spam and hence model performance was measured using precision 
 score. The precision score was around 97% which meant that a well 
 trained model was obtained at the end which could generalise well 
 to testing data.
